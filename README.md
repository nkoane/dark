# **DARK.**

an app|ication to track and **monitor rolling blackouts**, _ass_ (also sold as) load-shedding, in johannesburg (and maybe all of south africa).

i am only doing this because, well, i think there isn't a decent application built to monitor and track the rolling blackouts (load-shedding).

yeah, sure ``eish`` works, but dam, its ugly.

also, i am bored.

a. **UI+UX**:

1. minimalist clean ui
2. human intitutive interface
3. fair amount AI

b. **f(n)**:

1. use my location, first;
2. or ask me for the area i am interested in;
3. then apply some ``fuzzy logic`` to produce a schedule.

That's it so far, I will more as I go along. I will also expand the above _maslow pyramid of needs_, el-oh-el.

Salut!
